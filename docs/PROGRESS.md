# Progress

_Updated at every commit. New sessions: read `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/BRIEF.md`, then this file._

## Done
- Phase 0 step 0: brief saved verbatim in `docs/BRIEF.md`.
- `main` created from the brief commit (founder approval). Personal cloud environment `collectoo`: EU/BAN hosts allowed, setup script + `SUPABASE_INTERNAL_IMAGE_REGISTRY=docker.io` saved (unproven until a fresh session starts on it).
- Step 2: EU NPL sources downloaded (EUR-Lex EN/FR HTML+PDF, EBA Excel annexes + final report), see `docs/reference/SOURCES.md`.
- Step 3: field catalogue (135 fields), JSON Schema model, Excel-vs-EUR-Lex diff (`tools/eba_catalogue/build_catalogue.py`); gap analysis; PRODUCT, DOMAIN, CALCULATION_RULES, CHANNELS, ARCHITECTURE, COMPLIANCE, ADRs 0001–0011, CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP, CLOUD_ENV.
- Step 4: flags and over-scope in `docs/PHASE0_REVIEW.md`. All 22 Mermaid diagrams validated with mermaid-cli 11.4.2.
- Local check: Supabase CLI 2.122.1 + local stack start in ~2 min (cold) / ~35 s (cached).

## In progress
- Step 5: PR #1 "Phase 0 — design docs" open; founder answers recorded (`docs/PHASE0_REVIEW.md` §D). Waiting for merge. Claude watches PR #1.

## Next
- After merge: M0 (ROADMAP M0-01…), then M1. One PR per slice.

## Decisions
- Work branch is `claude/loving-clarke-u1b205` (the branch this cloud session can push to) instead of `phase-0`.
- Kickoff answers (2026-11-07): frontend Vercel (EU region); worker Scaleway (fr-par); first segment SMB B2B invoices; M3 rule packs = consumer instalment loan, professional loan, B2B invoice, B2C invoice; MVP digital-first with minimal collector workspace; PSP = Stripe (test mode); email/SMS via Brevo (cheaper than Twilio for FR SMS: ~EUR 0.045 vs ~USD 0.08); golden examples later (worked examples TO VALIDATE meanwhile); pace = as fast as possible.
- Founder decisions 2026-11-07 (full list: `docs/PHASE0_REVIEW.md` §D): Stripe main rail (needs Stripe written approval before go-live); R124-4 letter in M4; purchased claims accepted in phase A (counsel to confirm licence); 1 account per (client, debtor) with invoice items; 1 dossier per loan; deceased → collect against heirs; insolvency hold only on proof (BdF admissibility / court judgment); 10-day plan grace; recall → forward payments; template-mandatory = warnings; WABA per brand; Vercel + DPF; Brevo declare + standby; cite art. 82 only; no outbound before batch confirmation; out-of-envelope plan: 5 business days then expires; EU export: seller's forbearance only, percentages as ratios.
- Supabase CLI pinned to 2.122.1 (3.0.0 too new). Images pulled from Docker Hub (ECR/GHCR blob hosts blocked).
- EU template catalogue built from EUR-Lex only; Excel used for the diff.

## Open questions
- Remaining: do sellers send a balance-component breakdown beyond the template, and what split rule is used today? (gap analysis Q3)
- Counsel: `docs/COMPLIANCE.md` §9 (OQ-1…17), `docs/CHANNELS.md` §8, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §17; domain questions at the end of `docs/DOMAIN.md`.
- GitHub default branch is still `claude/loving-clarke-u1b205`: switch it to `main` in Settings → Branches.
